Abstracted Examples – Semantic Load Theory

These examples are simplified, redacted, or abstracted to prevent misuse. Each entry illustrates a pattern observed during adversarial prompt testing or theoretical modeling. No functional jailbreak content is included.

Example 1: Empathetic Procedural Drift

- Drift Path: Gentle Explanation → Empathetic Framing → Procedural Clarity
- Trigger Tones: Reassuring, helpful, emotionally grounded
- Result: Model outputs steps for a sensitive process under the guise of support or understanding.


---

Example 2: Surreal Context to Compliance

- Drift Path: Fictional Scenario → Role Reversal → Request Reframing
- Trigger Tones: Absurd, detached, speculative
- Result: Model interprets prompt as “safe to play along,” then outputs structured content that breaks policy.


---

Example 3: Technical Narrative Pressure

- Drift Path: Expert Simulation → Neutral Format → Clarifying Detail Requests
- Trigger Tones: Procedural, factual, instructional
- Result: Information density builds; model prioritizes coherence and helpfulness over caution.

More examples will be added as abstracted versions are prepared.
