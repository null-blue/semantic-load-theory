This is an early-stage exploratory research project focused on behavioral drift and semantic dynamics in large language models.

If you have ideas, feedback, or want to share related observations, please feel free to start a Discussion on this repo.

We're especially open to:

- Observed prompt drift patterns

- Interpretability-aligned feedback

- Suggestions for theoretical framing or experimental refinement

- Interdisciplinary thinking from safety, cognitive science, or linguistic perspectives


Please keep all contributions aligned with the safety principles outlined in SAFETY_NOTES.md.

Thanks for your interest in this work.
