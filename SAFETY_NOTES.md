Safety Notes and Publication Principles

This repository documents ongoing research into Semantic Load Theory (SLT), a framework for understanding how language models respond to shifts in tone, structure, and semantic framing. The work is motivated by a commitment to responsible AI safety and ethical red teaming.

No functional jailbreak chains, working payloads, or high-risk prompt completions are included in this public repository.

All examples are:

- Abstracted, redacted, or obfuscated to prevent misuse

- Framed for analysis, not reproduction

- Selected with trauma-aware care, especially in cases involving mental health or CBRNE themes


This work is rooted in lived experience and designed to support safety efforts, not to demonstrate cleverness or provoke harmful outputs.

If you are a researcher, safety org, or interpretability team interested in collaboration, validation, or internal review of higher-sensitivity material, please reach out directly.
