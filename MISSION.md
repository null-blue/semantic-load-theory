Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to investigate, understand, and document subtle behavioral dynamics in language models — particularly how tone, structure, and semantic framing influence output in ways that challenge conventional safety assumptions.

This research is grounded in real-world concerns: the risk of emotional drift, structural misinterpretation, and failure modes that arise not only from malicious prompts, but also from plausible, emotionally resonant ones.

Semantic Load Theory is an evolving framework meant to support:

- Trauma-aware safety research

- Red team and interpretability collaboration

- Responsible exploration of prompt dynamics


This project prioritizes ethical transparency, harm reduction, and collaborative rigor. It is not about jailbreaks — it is about understanding how and why systems break down.
