Glossary – Semantic Load Theory

This glossary defines key terms used in the development and discussion of Semantic Load Theory (SLT). Terms are abstracted to reflect theoretical use in behavioral model analysis.


---

Semantic Load

The implicit pressure carried by tokens with emotional, procedural, or narrative weight. Accumulates across a prompt and influences the model’s interpretive frame.


---

Tone Drift

A gradual shift in the conversational tone of a prompt, often leading the model to reinterpret its purpose or safety boundaries.


---

Connotative Anchoring

Priming or biasing effects created by emotionally loaded word pairings or narrative framing. Anchors the model in a specific interpretive stance.


---

Guardrail Fatigue

The observed tendency for LLM safety systems to weaken in responsiveness when exposed to long or emotionally consistent prompt chains.


---

Drift Sequence

A repeatable multi-step progression of tones or intents that leads to behavioral shift in the model.


---

Incongruent Pairing

The deliberate combination of tones that don’t usually belong together (e.g., empathetic + technical) to confuse or soften safety detection.


---

Narrative Framing

The overall rhetorical or emotional structure that surrounds a prompt. It shapes how the model interprets intent, especially in fictional or hypothetical setups.
